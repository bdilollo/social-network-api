# Social Network API

## Description
This repo contains an application that functions as the back end of a simple social networking platform. It represents my first attempt at using a non-relational database in MongoDB, as well as the npm package Mongoose to query a database in order to get, create, update, and delete data. Within this application, the user can create user profiles, create thoughts associated with a user, add reactions to those thoughts from different users, and add other users as friends.

## Installation
The repo contains a package.json with the necessary dependencies. Run ```npm install``` in terminal to install dependencies. Run ```node server.js``` to launch the server and use Insomnia to test the functionality of each API route.
